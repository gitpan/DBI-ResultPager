DBI::ResultPager 0.9.2

This class is a quick and easy method of paging result sets returned
from the DBI database interface.  It takes a standard SQL query along
with a database handle and performs the query, inserting the resultant
rows into a pageable HTML table.  Various options such as sort order can
be adjusted, and columns can have formatters attached.  Columns can also
be hidden, and custom columns can be added to the output.

See the POD documentation for examples and more details.  Source code is
